# Architecture

Why this monorepo is shaped the way it is. Day-to-day commands: [README](README.md);
contribution rules: [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md); the estate-wide contract:
[OMNI-CORE](https://github.com/WyattAu/engineering-standards/blob/main/OMNI-CORE.md).

## Principles

1. **One source of truth per concern.** One lockfile pins the toolchain; one
   scripts/ directory knows how to build; one CI workflow gates merges.
   Nothing important is duplicated per package.
2. **Packages are the unit of reuse; the repo is the unit of consistency.**
   Each package builds and tests independently; the workspace keeps them
   reproducible together.
3. **Everything is CLI-first.** `make` targets work identically in a terminal,
   VS Code, Neovim, and CI. IDE integrations are conveniences layered on top,
   never requirements.
4. **The pipeline is the contract.** If `make ci` passes locally, CI passes
   remotely. CI runs exactly what `make ci` runs — no special CI-only steps.

## Layout

```
OmniRust-template/
├── Cargo.toml            workspace + [workspace.lints] (single lint source)
├── rust-toolchain.toml   shared toolchain pin (stable + rustfmt/clippy/rust-src)
├── crates/omni-core      L0 leaf — no_std-capable, REQ-tagged, fuzzed, benched
├── crates/omni-service   L3 composition — axum, health/ready, graceful shutdown
├── crates/omni-cli       clap binary composing on omni-core
├── xtask/                workspace task runner (scripts stay canonical)
├── fuzz/                 cargo-fuzz harnesses
├── supply-chain/         cargo-vet (audits + imports)
├── scripts/  + Makefile  the gates (make ci == CI)
├── docs/adr/             decision log
└── .github/ .forgejo/ .devcontainer/ .vscode/ flake.nix .envrc
```

## Environments (three equal doors, one source of truth)

| Door | What it uses | When |
|---|---|---|
| nix + direnv (host) | `flake.nix` devShell | daily driver on nix-capable hosts |
| Devcontainer — image | language base image | zero-setup, works everywhere |
| Devcontainer — nix | `.devcontainer/nix/` | nix semantics inside a container |

All three resolve to the same toolchain versions because nix/flake is the
system-dependency source of truth and the language-native lockfile (checked
in) is the package source of truth.

## CI shape

- push(main) + pull_request + **monthly bitrot cron** (catches ecosystem
  drift push/PR never see).
- One **experimental allowed-fail leg** tracking the next toolchain version.
- Reusable estate gates where the language has one
  (see [engineering-standards](https://github.com/WyattAu/engineering-standards)).
- Releases: CHANGELOG + tag; per-language publisher with artifact attestation.
